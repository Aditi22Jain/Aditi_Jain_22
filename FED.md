			FACIAL EXPRESSION DETECTION

1)	Description :
•	The project is based on detecting different types of face expressions . For ex : 
i.	Sad 
ii.	Happy 
iii.	Disgust 
iv.	Angry
v.	Fear
vi.	Surprise and
vii.	Neutral faces

•	The project has been trained on around 29000 images which belong to 7 classes and has been tested on around 7200 images.
•	Thus , while training the weights , I also trained       the model which gave me the accuracy of 80%.
•	 80%  accuracy suggest that the model can make       mistakes while predicting some of the images ; it’s    not 100% accurate and up to the mark. 
•	 Which means that while predicting the image of a disgust face it may predict it as a sad or neutral face or while predicting the happy face it may give the result as surprise face.

2)	 Installation : 
•	For building this project one must install anaconda or use command prompt to run the code .
•	Programmer should install the certain libraries required for successful completion of code.
•	Programmer should have the proper dataset downloaded or manually built to train , test , validate the model.
3)	 Usage : 
•	 Libraries used are : 
Matplotlib ,  pyplot , tensorflow , numpy , cv2 , keras .
•	Model used is Sequential .
•	Different layers are also used in model .

4)	 Project status : 
The project on the facial expression detection has been completed successfully .

5)	 Acknowledgement : 
   I would like to appreciate my teachers who helped me a lot in completing this project and solved my queries related to the project .
